\method{analyze_basket}{simon_design}(
  data,
  design,
  ...,
  alpha = NULL,
  beta = NULL,
  design_type = NULL,
  interim_data = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{basket_data} object containing the trial data}

\item{design}{A \code{simon_design} object created by \code{simon_design()}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (not currently used, for S3 consistency)}

\item{alpha}{Significance level for each individual basket. If not provided,
uses alpha from design object. For family-wise error rate control at level
epsilon across K baskets, set alpha = epsilon/K in the design.}

\item{beta}{Type II error rate (1 - power) for each basket. If not provided,
uses beta from design object. Default is 0.20 (80\% power).}

\item{design_type}{Character string indicating Simon design type. If not provided,
uses design_type from design object.}

\item{interim_data}{Optional \code{simon_result} object with stage 1 results. If NULL,
assumes \code{data} represents stage 1.}
}
\value{
A list with class "simon_result" containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{rejections}: Logical vector indicating rejected baskets
\item \code{p_values}: P-values for each basket (from exact binomial test)
\item \code{design_params}: Simon design parameters for each basket (r1, n1, r, n)
\item \code{stage1_continue}: Logical vector indicating which baskets continued to stage 2
\item \code{futility_stopped}: Logical vector indicating which baskets stopped for futility
}
}
\description{
Implements independent Simon optimal two-stage designs for each basket. This
serves as a reference design for comparison with basket trial methods that
borrow information across baskets. Each basket is analyzed separately without
any information sharing.
}
\details{
The Simon two-stage design (Simon 1989) is the standard approach for single-arm
phase II trials. For basket trials, this corresponds to running K independent
Simon designs in parallel, one per basket.

\strong{Stage 1}: Enroll n1 patients. If <= r1 responses observed, stop for futility.
Otherwise continue to stage 2.

\strong{Stage 2}: Enroll additional n2 = n - n1 patients. Reject null hypothesis
if total responses across both stages > r.

The design parameters (r1, n1, r, n) are chosen to:
\itemize{
\item Control type I error at alpha under null response rate (p0)
\item Achieve power (1 - beta) under alternative response rate (p1)
\item Minimize expected sample size under H0 (optimal design)
\item OR minimize maximum sample size n (minimax design)
}

This implementation uses the clinfun::ph2simon algorithm for parameter selection.
