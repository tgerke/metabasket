Description: Provides a unified interface for designing, simulating, and analyzing 
    basket trials using multiple established methods. The package wraps existing 
    implementations (bmabasket, basket, bhmbasket, clinfun::ph2simon) and provides consistent functions 
    for comparing operating characteristics and generating protocol language. 
    Basket trials evaluate a single therapy across multiple cancer types or subtypes 
    simultaneously.
